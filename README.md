# Idea Management API
This is an Idea management API. The user must first authenticate in order to use it. After the user has been authenticated successfully, they can now perform CRUD operations on ideas.
The API also manages suggestions as an added functionality and this does not require quthentication so as to keep suggestion submitters anonymous.

# Getting started
This API was developed using spring boot and the reasons are:- Spring boot has an emebedded Tomcat server therefore no need to configure one, It is opinionated thus helping developers add and customise starter dependencies thus saving developers' time, it allows for dependency injections, it has a provision to run jars independently, presence of spring security which is great for authorization and authentication.
